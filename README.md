### 👋 Hey there! I'm johnzoki. 
By day, I'm an architecture student 🏛️, and by night, I'm a Python newbie trying not to break the internet 🐍.

### 🔧 Skills:

- **Python:** Still figuring out how to make my code do cool stuff without crashing.
- **IfcOpenShell:** I can bend building data to my will (mostly).
- **Discord API:** Making bots that do my bidding (or at least try to).

### 💡 Interests:

  - Trying to mesh architecture with coding without causing a meltdown.
  - Collecting Python errors like they’re Pokémon.
  
### 🎓 Background:

  - Architecture student with a knack for turning coffee ☕ into poorly documented code.
  - Coding as a hobby, because sleep is overrated.
  
### 📫 Connect with me:

  - If you love buildings, coding, or just want to laugh at my code, hit me up!
